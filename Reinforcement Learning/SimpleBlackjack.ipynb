        "Here, we're going to use Q-learning to \"solve\" infinite deck blackjack. Pretending there are infinite decks means that card counting is irrelevant, which really reduces the state space.\n",
        "\n",
        "We consider a simple action space where the player can only choose to *hit* (get another card) or *stand* (stay with the current total in hand).\n",
        "\n",
        "We also abstract from betting and just try to figure out how to win. Each hand will have three possible outcomes: win (with reward = 1), draw (with reward = 0), and lose (with reward = -1).\n",
        "\n",
        "We will make the environment simple. If the player hits and ends up with a total greater than 21, the player immediately loses. If the player stands before reaching 21, the dealer must play until having cards totalling at least 17. If the dealer draws a card producing a total more than 21 or has a total smaller than the player's total, the player wins. If the dealer and player both have the same total, the game ends in a draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "With these rules in mind, the state space the player needs to keep track of consists of just three things: the sum of the player's cards (12-21), the dealer's card (1-10), and whether the player has a useable ace (aces can count as 1 or 11). This gives only 200 possible states - which is a pretty manageable state space.\n"
